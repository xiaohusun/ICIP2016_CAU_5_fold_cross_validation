We release the 5-fold cross validation test setting on CAU for easy and fair comparison between methods.

The test setting is adopted in our ICIP 2016 paper on age estimation:

H. Liu, X. Sun, "Linear Canonical Correlation Analysis Based Ranking Approach for Facial Age Estimation," in ICIP, 2016.

Point (facial landmarks) files of the images in CAU can be downloaded from
